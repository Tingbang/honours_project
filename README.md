Darren Lally's Honours Project, Student Number: S1622370 - 
This project was developed using Django Web Framework.

Project Title: Investigation into what contributing factors aided the rapid growth of using Python with Django-Framework over using PHP for developing web-applications.
Research Question: Can the development of an online revision application help to fully investigate the factors that contributed to the large growth in web applications created using Python instead of PHP?

Project Aim: The aim of this project is to develop a full web-based revision application for students using Python with Django Web-Framework, and then building partial web-components using PHP to help accurately draw conclusions how both languages handle similar tasks. The proposed application at a high-level will allows students to upload course material, create and view course content in the form of lessons, generate and take part in quizzes, and be able to view various statistics on their quiz results.
